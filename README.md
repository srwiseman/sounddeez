INTRODUCTION
=====
This project provides a different front-end to WiFi connected Bose Soundtouch sound systems. This came about by a few problems I had with the official Bose app:

a) anyone who visited your house and wanted to play music had to download the app.

b) There was no way to "queue up" a song so that it played after other songs were played.

This project basically turns your device into a virtual jukebox. Anyone on your WiFi can queue up or play any song available on Deezer.
